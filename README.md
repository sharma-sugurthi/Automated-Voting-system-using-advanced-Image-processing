***The **Security** and **Accuracy** of voting systems are crucial for ensuring free and fair elections.
Traditional voting methods, both paper-based and electronic, are often prone to issues such as
voter fraud, impersonation, and tampering. This project proposes a biometric-based voting
machine leveraging image processing techniques to address these challenges. The system uses
biometric traits, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, for voter authentication. Image
processing methods, including preprocessing, feature extraction, and pattern matching, are
employed to ensure accurate and reliable identification.<br><br>
The system is implemented using MATLAB, incorporating a user-friendly interface for voters
to cast their votes securely. Once authenticated, the voter can select their preferred candidate,
and the vote is securely stored in an encrypted database, ensuring data integrity. The proposed
system enhances voting efficiency, reduces the risk of fraud, and ensures a transparent election
process. With the growing importance of security and trust in democratic systems, this project
demonstrates how advanced biometric and image processing technologies can revolutionize
voting systems.***
